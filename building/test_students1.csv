1,393955,866643,-1,"<p>As mentioned previously, PHP seems like a very important language to learn for students. It serves as a backbone for websites and web applications, and it will continue to be in useÂ for a long time. While it is an older language to compared to others, I do not think another language will totally replace it in the near future. More likely scenarios could be that PHP continues to be updated with new features, or another language that is based on PHP comesÂ into wider use.Â </p>","[ ""website"", ""feature"" ]",0.208,2015-09-21T01:07:03Z
1,393955,864058,870450,"<p>Maybe we can look at Flash (Actionscript) as an example. ActionscriptÂ has been a popular language for games and web apps for a long time, but it has waned in popularity and it seems like not many developers areÂ learning or using Actionscript anymore. Even within SIAT, when I took IAT 167 in Spring 2013 we did the whole course in Actionscript, but now that course uses Processing. I do not think learning Actionscript was a waste of time though, since the principles of programming that we learned in that class applyÂ to other languages. What do you guys think?</p>","[ ""programming"", ""popularity"" ]",0.162,2015-09-25T01:31:40Z
1,393955,870613,879188,"<p>Processing is definitely limiting and has its problems as a language, but I would not say it is useless. It was always meant to be a simple language for visual artists to learn and use, and there are goodÂ reasons for why it is popular within the context it was meant for. As one of the first programming languages for SIAT students, I think it is a reasonable choice.</p>
<p>It would be great if Processing's javascript output mode was more usable, but there are libraries like three.js that have similar syntax as Processing and students can easily pick those up without much trouble. Also, I do not think a language needs to run on every platform to be deemed useful.</p>","[ ""programming"" ]",0.209,2015-09-26T05:15:43Z
1,393955,877563,879222,"<p>It could possibly! I do not know enough about PHP to even know its shortcomings yet, so I am not sure how Hack addresses those things. If Hack convinces enough developers to switch to it over PHP, it might become popular.</p>
<p>This transition, if it happens at all, will take a long time as corporations cannot force developers to make that switch overnight. Well, I guess companies like Apple and Google can force developers to switch to new languages (Apple - Swift, Google - Go) by dropping support for apps written in older languages..</p>

1,393955,881093,885356,"<p>So I guessÂ courses like 352 should teach programming principles to students usingÂ more established languages that have lots of examples available, and let the students decide if they want to pick up a newer language in the future.Â Companies can always change their direction for these new languages, so it would be riskyÂ for Â schools to adopt something like that.</p>","[ ""programming"" ]",0.115,2015-09-28T20:29:28Z
1,393955,876815,885377,"<p>Yes, Java applets always feel like a security risk so I never run those things when prompted by a web browser. I posted above that school coursesÂ should not jump on new programming languages hastily, but I also think that courses should be aware of technology trends so that they are not stuck on teaching languages that are not useful anymore. It would be totally backwardsÂ for a web developmentÂ course to teach Java instead of Javascript in 2015.</p>","[ ""programming"", ""web development"", ""trend"" ]",0.116,2015-09-28T20:36:49Z
1,389072,925497,929088,"<p>I agree with your points.Â Data management is very difficult, and comprehending all that data to come up with a useful conclusion is another big challenge. Adding to the size issue is the validity of the formulas used and the data itself. With Google Flu Trends tool, Google attempted to use Google searches (500 million queries a day, as of 2013)Â to come up with accurate figures for how many people have the flu, but they've been consistentlyÂ wrong on that front. Using big data can mean that there are bigger statisticalÂ problems to solve.</p>

1,389071,975867,-1,"<p>I believe that cloud computing is transforming computing to a new level. According to PC Mag, cloud computing means ""storing and accessing data and programs over the Internet instead of your computer's hard drive"". (<a href=""http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2372163,00.asp"">http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2372163,00.asp</a>)</p>
<p>This concept is hardly new, but the types of cloud computing applications available to consumers today are far more advanced than before. For example, Google Drive allows anyone with a device (smartphone, tablet, computer) and Internet connection to create and collaborate onÂ documents, spreadsheets and slideshows. 20 years ago, weÂ couldn't collaborate on documents in real-time on their phones using wireless internet. Now we can.</p>
<p>Today's cloud computing isÂ amazing, because server farms located far away are doing all the heavy work and essentially turning our computers into thin clients. Services like OnLive and Gaikai allow high-end video games to run on any computer with good enough Internet connection, since all the rendering is done on their servers. Services like YouTube and Netflix store incalculable hours of video on their servers and make them available to us on demand. In a few years, devicesÂ with just a web browser - like a Google Chromebook -Â could become people's main computers. Isn't this a new level for computing?</p>","[ ""cloud computing"", ""demand"" ]",0.188,2015-11-15T01:40:08Z
1,389071,975867,1006328,"<p>Yes, security is becoming a bigger concernÂ as we move our computing activities to the cloud. We just do not know what these companies are doing with our data. They could be mismanaging our data or handing them over to the government (ex. Microsoft handingÂ over email and Skype data to the NSAÂ <a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jul/11/microsoft-nsa-collaboration-user-data"">http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jul/11/microsoft-nsa-collaboration-user-data</a>)Â and we have no way of knowing about these things. Protective lawsÂ are being put in place, but they can be slow to catch up with technology. And laws are written in favour of corporations or government entities, rather than the consumers, as per usual.</p>",[],-2,2015-11-30T21:21:19Z
1,389071,1000333,1006340,"<p>We definitely should be more careful about what we're strain online. Here's a news article about a password storage service getting hacked:Â <a href=""http://arstechnica.com/security/2015/06/hack-of-cloud-based-lastpass-exposes-encrypted-master-passwords/"">http://arstechnica.com/security/2015/06/hack-of-cloud-based-lastpass-exposes-encrypted-master-passwords/</a></p>
<p>Although hackers will likely not be able to crack the hashed passwords, it is still disturbing that hackers were able to get data off of a service that stores ALL of your passwords for different sites you visit. This means a hacker could simply hack this one service to get a user's password for dozens of different services, exponentially increasing the amount of damage they can cause. Things like passwords and sensitiveÂ information should really be kept off the cloud, but we tend toÂ trade convenience for security when it comes to the Internet and the cloud.</p>",[],-2,2015-11-30T21:27:59Z
